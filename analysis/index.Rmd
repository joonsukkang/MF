  + The model is fitted with a fixed sparse binary prior (for $w$) setting.
  + A grid of the binary values (a value close to zero and a large value) are explored.
  + This shows that there exist settings in which the method works.
+ demo version 3: [demo3](model_exp_prior.html)
  + The model is fitted with an exponential prior (for $w$) setting.

+ investigation of warmstart advantage  : [warmstart](warmstart.html)
  + The warmstart advantage disappears when we restrict to rank-1 approximation. Rather than the current marginal fitting of factors, joint estimation of multiple factors may be the key to obtaining a better solution.
